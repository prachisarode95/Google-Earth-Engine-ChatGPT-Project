## üå¨Ô∏è Air Quality Research (Preprocessing before starting to prompt): Preparing NO‚ÇÇ Data for Air Quality Analysis over New Delhi

### Objective:

As an **Air Quality Researcher** specializing in remote sensing, the objective is to proficiently employ the **Google Earth Engine JavaScript API** for air quality assessments over New Delhi to retrieve, filter, and visualize Sentinel-5P NO2 images for further analysis and classification. 

### Steps:

1. **Retrieve Sentinel-5P NO2 Image Collection**
   The Sentinel-5P NO2 data is available in the following collection:

   ```javascript
   var no2Collection = ee.ImageCollection("COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_NO2");
   ```

2. **Filter the Collection by Date Range**
   The dataset should be filtered to include images from **November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2024**:

   ```javascript
   var filteredNO2 = no2Collection.filterDate('2024-11-01', '2024-11-30');
   ```

3. **Extract Suitable Bands for NO2 Surface Results**
   To focus on the NO2 data, select the relevant band for nitrogen dioxide:

   ```javascript
   var no2 = filteredNO2.select('NO2_column_number_density');
   ```

4. **Extract Administrative Boundary of New Delhi**
   You will use the provided feature collection to extract the boundary of New Delhi:

   ```javascript
   var newDelhi = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/geoboundaries/CGAZ_ADM1")
     .filter(ee.Filter.eq('shapeName', 'Delhi'));
   ```

5. **Apply Visualization Parameters**
   Set the color palette to visualize NO2 levels with a range from "white" to "red" as follows:

   ```javascript
   var visParams = {
     min: 0.0,
     max: 0.0005,
     palette: ['white', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'red']
   };
   ```

6. **Visualize the Data**
   Add the filtered NO2 image to the map with the chosen visualization parameters and overlay the boundary of New Delhi:

   ```javascript
   var no2Map = no2.mean().clip(newDelhi);
   Map.centerObject(newDelhi, 10);
   Map.addLayer(no2Map, visParams, 'NO2 Levels');
   Map.addLayer(newDelhi.style({color: 'black', fillColor: '00000000'}), {}, 'New Delhi Boundary');
   ```

7. **Export Image (Optional)**
   Optionally, you can export the processed image for further use:

   ```javascript
   Export.image.toDrive({
     image: no2Map,
     description: 'NO2_Image_NewDelhi',
     scale: 1000,
     region: newDelhi
   });
   ```

##  üìå Prompt Log: Air Quality Assessment over New Delhi using preprocessed NO‚ÇÇ Data

### üîπ Prompt 1: Composite Images & Statistics

Continuing your role as an Air Quality Researcher, your next task is to display different composites of NO‚ÇÇ images in the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API for advanced air quality assessments over New Delhi.

**Task: Retrieve Composite Image Statistics**

From the previous code, select the band used again and obtain the **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **maximum**, and **minimum** composite images for NO‚ÇÇ. Display each composite by clipping them over the New Delhi Boundary in the map to understand the NO‚ÇÇ distribution and concentration comprehensively.

**Task: Print Results**

Print out all the **mean values** from the Mean Composite in the console.

---

### üîπ Prompt 2: Image Classification

**Task: Classification of NO‚ÇÇ Levels**

Based on the statistical values of the mean NO‚ÇÇ composite, which is `0.00017628374591946718 mol/m¬≤`, create four distinct concentration classes:

- "Low Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ"
- "Moderate Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ"
- "High Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ"
- "Highest Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ"

Use a suitable classification algorithm to define concentration thresholds for each class. Display the classified result on the map, and clip the resulting classified image with the **New Delhi Boundary**.

**Map Visualization**

Use the following colours to represent each class in the classified image:

- Green: Low Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ
- Orange: Moderate Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ
- Red: High Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ
- Black: Highest Concentration of NO‚ÇÇ

Create a **legend** for the following color range to identify the classes on the map.

---

### üîπ Prompt 3: Print Classified Results

**Task: Output Classified Values**

Print out the results of the classified image into the console, focusing on printing the **NO‚ÇÇ concentration values** of each class separately with a **description** from the classified image.
